Hyperbolic Quantum Error Correction Codes Threshold. 

This repository contains the accompanying source code for the paper "A Systematic Approach to Hyperbolic Quantum Error Correction Codes".

## Running the Python file
It's recommended to use a version of python >= 3.10.6
```
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Hyperbolic_Code_Threshold.py
```
The python file is the same file that was used to generate Figure 3 in the paper. We encourage reading through the code carefully before running it. Here is a brief overview of what the code does.

### High-level overview
A periodic {p, q} hyperbolic lattice with N faces and its corresponding quantum circuit are generated. Each data point in the figure is generated as follows. Some random error is applied to some qubits in the circuit based on the current error probability. We then find whether the correction paths generated by Minimum Weight Perfect Matching would result in a logical error according to the logical operators. This process is repeated for a set number of trials (we default to 10000) and then repeated for different number of faces. 

To speed up the trials, we utilize Python's multiprocessing library. For 10000 trials, it takes 6+ hours on an 8-core machine to generate the figure. The number of trials can be adjusted to control the accuracy and runtime.

Some drawings have been turned off by default. This can be overriden as desired by setting `draw=True` in the various places where it is currently set to `False`.
